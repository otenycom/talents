# Tools an Oteny bot can use

> **Generated** by Oteny — do not edit by hand. This is the catalog of tools your
> Talent can request. The Oteny platform runs every tool inside a scope-locked
> harness and meters paid ones at cost — you request a tool, you never wire one up.

**This catalog answers WHICH tools exist. For HOW to call one — the exact
parameters, result shape, error modes, and a worked example per tool — read the
generated [`tools-reference.md`](tools-reference.md) (machine twin:
`tools-contracts.json`). Author against those; never reverse-engineer a tool
from a live box.**

**How to request a tool in `agent-profile.yaml`:**

- A **first-party tool** (web search, images, the browser, file sharing, account
  links) → list its **request name** under `tools.required`.
- A **built-in toolset** (schedule, memory, run code) → list it under
  `toolset_contribution`.

Cost: **Included** (no per-use charge) · **A fraction of a cent** (metered at cost) ·
**Billed by length** (the bot confirms before running). Mark a tool you depend on but
that may be absent as `stubbed` only if it is genuinely off — never stub a **live** tool
(the lint fails a stale claim).

*Skill to compose* names the building-block skill **already delivered on your
bot's box** that operates the tool at runtime (your skill composes on top of it,
and can tell the bot to load it) — it is not a file in this repo; read it on your
dev bot if you're curious. The authoring-side browser discipline lives in
[`browser-authoring.md`](browser-authoring.md).
